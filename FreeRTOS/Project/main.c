/*
 * main() creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.
 * The web documentation provides more details of the standard demo application
 * tasks, which provide no particular functionality but do provide a good
 * example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" task - This only executes every five seconds but has a high priority
 * to ensure it gets processor time.  Its main function is to check that all the
 * standard demo tasks are still operational.  While no errors have been
 * discovered the check task will print out "OK" and the current simulated tick
 * time.  If an error is discovered in the execution of a task then the check
 * task will print out an appropriate error message.
